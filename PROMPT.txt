only total attendance is visible on manager analytics, everything including, total students in, crowd % (can be calculated from capacity fetching from database), predictions, reviews, analysis should be visible, and also should be visible on the student predictions side also

Also make available different statistics available and shown in the managers UI (You may choose the apt statistics yourself)

additionally, the students who marked attendance are shown in the qr section of manager UI, i also want that the analytics section of manager should also show the marked attendance in slots of that day (can use dropdowns in breakfast, lunch, dinner individually, with the name of the students displayed, just like it's shown in the QR code section of manager UI)

auto train of the model (say every 7 days), Check if that's currently enabled in the code block.

How do i add these information about backup and data deletion in the firebase itself?

Attendance Records: Keep forever (for historical analysis)
Reviews: Keep forever (reputation data)
QR Codes: Delete after 1 week (cleanup old codes)
Predictions: Keep for 3 months (ML training data)
Sessions: Archive after 6 months

change in how reviews are stored in database and shown in manager's UI:
    - strucuture should be (in DB): reviews/<messId>/<date>/<slot as breakfast/lunch/dinner>/<review itself>
    - reviews submitting on the today's date and current slot (IMPORTANT!), like lunch reviews for 12-2pm... and so, should be visible at the managers side only. 
    - the point is, reviews submitted yesterday should not be visible today, and reviews submitted this morning for breakfast should not be visible now at lunch time. (This should be implemented by the slot collection in that date)

Scanning Problem still persists, can't open the camera in the web on mobile (didn't ask for permissions too) and thus marking attendance by qr scanning is not working.

On the web, using manager ui, i marked attendance for 1000 anonymous students in alder, trained the model manually, restarted backend, then reloaded the frontend ui, and when i saw the predictions, it was still like 0% students expected despite marking of 1000 students , Additionally, i saw this error in the web console as   [Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT firestore.googleapis…e&zx=keup4bw8e77x:1] AND:

----------- **PROBLEMS TO BE ADDRESSED** -----------------

camera error, still not accessible, keep in mind that we're only building the web version for our project as of now, no ios/android, hence make sure that the CAMERA is accessible and the qr code is scannable and the attendance can be marked, perfectly, NO BLOATS, I WANT 100% ACCURACY
---

only total attendance is visible on manager analytics, everything including, total students in, crowd % (can be calculated from capacity fetching from database), predictions, reviews, analysis should be visible, and also should be visible on the student predictions side also

Also make available different statistics available and shown in the managers UI (You may choose the apt statistics yourself)

---
additionally, the students who marked attendance are shown in the qr section of manager UI, i also want that the analytics section of manager should also show the marked attendance in slots of that day (can use dropdowns in breakfast, lunch, dinner individually, with the name of the students displayed, just like it's shown in the QR code section of manager UI)

---

What is SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here in .env.example, how do i get its value and fill there?
---

how would i get the Prediction API URL in frontend/lib/services/prediction_service.dart to be put during the deployment? (for now, its localhost:8080, where the backend server is running)

---

auto train of the model (say every 7 days), Check if that's currently enabled in the code block.
---

How do i add these information about backup and data deletion in the firebase itself?

Attendance Records: Keep forever (for historical analysis)
Reviews: Keep forever (reputation data)
QR Codes: Delete after 1 week (cleanup old codes)
Predictions: Keep for 3 months (ML training data)
Sessions: Archive after 6 months
---

Additionally, i'd earlier changed the firebase rules to:
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow unauthenticated read access to loginCredentials for login
    match /loginCredentials/{document=**} {
      allow read;
    }
 
    // Allow all other collections (temporary - tighten later)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

because the already written rule was not working properly, (unable to access the database...), in the database_schema.md, there's a different firestore security rules given, would i need to change that? or let it be this rule and don't change? Suggest that would definitely work and won't affect the performance of the application and also the security concerns are considered

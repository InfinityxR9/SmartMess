PROMPT_03

1) on student portal home screen, add manager's name and email where the information about mess is given under "Mess Information"

2) Critical BUG:
In the main.py of backend, minutes_back is not defined on Line 578
due to which predict and train APIs are not working as expected

3) Error: mobile_scanner: not starting automatically because autoStart is set to false in the controller. in console when trying to open scanning QR feature on student

4) If no training data is found, train the data and then run predict API 
ALSo reduce manual intervention and make sure the model is trained using the attendance data automatically

5) analyse and fix the exception: [Prediction] Error: TimeoutException after 0:00:30.000000: Future not completed

6) Make changes in the train_tensorflow.py, i don't think it is working correctly, it is not able to train the data (Stuck at [Query] when manually running it for alder), additionally, make sure if the serviceaccount...json is  not available, then use the account default credentials (possible in the gcp server)

7) Scanning Feature still not working, can't open the camera in the web, and can't scan to mark the attendance.. fix all of these problems

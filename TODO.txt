[NOT FOR DAKSH RATHI]
Prediction API URL in frontend/lib/services/prediction_service.dart
Cloud Run Endpoint after deployment

Should Create
backend/.env (from .env.example)
Sample data in Firestore collections

[FOR DAKSH RATHI]
First, create a new branch and start working on it:
open git bash in terminal in vs code
it should say something like:

daksh@... MINGW64 /.../SmartMess (master)
master -> means you're on master branch

use: git checkout -b develop 
this will create a new branch 'develop' and switch to it,
(Now, master would be replaced by 'develop')

To start the servers:
1) start the backend server 
2) build the frontend
3) start the frontend 
you may take help from the snippets written below

Before doing anything with the AI, you should run the servers and perform tests like adding/marking attendance, accessing reviews, accounts, authentication... check everything and make sure that everything is working fine.
You may check the web console (you can access via Ctrl+shift+I), the terminals of the servers running for any errors, You see any unknown error whose cause you don't know, message me.

I demonstrated the project when there were little to no errors at all (Just Logical Problems), so, I want before doing anything forward, your PC and mine are at same level, by checking everything is alright. (Don't hussle in this process, and do each and every debug testing calmly)

I'm also adding your github registered email id (iamdakshrathi@gmail.com) to the viewer for firebase database, so that you may access it and look at the details for login and other things. You will not have edit permissions, if you want that, contact me.

If you face any problem, CONTACT ME.

Open the chat session, [NOTE: Do all these with the repo opened in the vscode (work in root directory)]
select Claude Haiku 
Paste the prompt in the chat (You can change some part of prompt, as explained below), if it asks for write, let it have it and don't undo if it asks after writing files, let it run scripts in terminals, if it asks so.

The prompt above the text "----------- **PROBLEMS TO BE ADDRESSED** -----------------" in PROMPT.txt can be changed, it is meant to explain to the AI about our project, i've written some part, however you may change/add it.

[IMPORTANT]
You may need a serviceAccountKey.json file (it might throw errors regarding the connection is not there)
If you feel like there're errors that weren't there when i demonstrated it, ask me directly.
This file is never committed to the github, hence i posses it only.

[TO RUN THE SERVERS]
SNIPPETS:
run backend:

cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py 

run frontend:
by building (production build)

Build:
cd frontend
flutter build web --release

Run:
cd frontend/build/web
python -m http.server 8888

Direct run: (debug)
flutter run -d edge

[MORE INTEGRATIONS and PROBLEMS]

Add a proper "How to completely run project" in readme. that includes donwloading sdk, python.. etc, and installing dependencies, by means of creating venvs, etc..

show mess manager name in student profile 
Integrate create manu in manager completely and start integrating "show menu" in student ui

change in how reviews are stored in database and shown in manager's UI:
    - strucuture should be (in DB): reviews/<messId>/<date>/<review itself>
    - reviews submitting on the today's date and current slot (IMPORTANT!), like lunch reviews for 12-2pm... and so, should be visible at the managers side only. 
    - the point is, reviews submitted yesterday should not be visible today, and reviews submitted this morning for breakfast should not be visible now at lunch time.

The Predictions should be refereshed at the 15 minutes interval slots, Since we're collecting data for students going inside only, not coming out, so we perform predictions based on the data of how many students were inside the mess in last 15 minutes only.

Eg, Lunch starts at 12pm and ends at 2pm, so the predictions will be refereshed at following slots,
    12:15pm (First Prediction, based on data of students that went inside from 12-12:15 only)
    12:30pm (Second Prediction, based on data of students that went inside from 12:15-12:30 only)
    and so on...

This is a critical bug and feature enhancement that needs to be done.
